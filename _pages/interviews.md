I've long thought my personal site titled too much towards my web work and none of my random side projects, which are plentiful. Years ago, I used to list them, but I started thinking a certain point that they'd be viewed as a distraction. Now, I care less.

Eventually, I'll list some of my favorite side quests over the years.
