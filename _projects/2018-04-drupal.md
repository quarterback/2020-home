*This talk is from Drupal 2018 in Nashville. I was part of a small team that migrated a city website from an in-house CMS to Drupal. The reasons for moving to Drupal were made before we took over, but this talk covers some of the challenges we faced through the process.*

Some of the highlights include:
**Tackling content debt.** How we cut the site from several thousand pages to just ~500 without causing a mutiny.
  
**Managing web governance.** Ways to assign responsibility for managing content across departments, by engaging with stakeholders early and often through the process using actionable goals, documentation & timelines to move things forward.
  
**Balancing user needs with technical considerations.** As a development team having to integrate UX considerations and handling content, we had more than just software issues to balance. How do you work with a team of developers to manage these responsibilities, without causing lots of extra work, and keeping users satisfied throughout the process into post-launch.
