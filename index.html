<h4>Work</h4>
<p>
	I lead cross-functional teams and work on impactful, people-focused design products and initiatives. I've spent over a decade working on large-scale digital transformation and shipping things like websites to millions of users. I'm also really good at the hidden stuff away from view -- stakeholder management, coaching, and building teams. 
	
	<p>Over the years, my work includes product strategy & digital transformation for complex institutions,  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REUJCWpFOcI">content management systems deployments and migrations</a>, information architecture, user research & service design. </p>

	<p>These days, my practice is focused on interrogating the ways harm is crafted into everyday experiences, and examining new ways for building teams, frameworks, and mental models for reducing friction that ruins experience, centered around a set of principles called <em><a href="https://consequence.design/post/616408785711431680/on-consequence-design">Consequence Design</a></em>.</p>
