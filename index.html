		<h1>Post-Service Designer</h1>
		<p>I speak globally on iterative design, information architecture, product design, and a diverse array of UX-related topics. My day job is leading the product design at <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov">18F</a>, a digital services agency inside the U.S. federal government. </p>

	 <p>My talks around focused around reducing hostility, quantifying the cost of friction in design, and interrogating how designers have abdicated our responsibility for destructive patterns across digital products. I've been calling it<em>Consequence Design</em>. </p>

		<p>Despite all of that, I'm pretty fun at parties.  I'm happy to offer <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/omnivoreron">music recs</a>, loose-leaf tea tips, or talk to you about how much I enjoy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_navSFGj0I">Pes√§pallo.</a>  I've been a lifelong fan of the New Jersey Devils, and (inexplicably) Toronto Blue Jays.
		Sometimes, I coach high school tennis and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_polo">invented a sport</a>, once. Right now, I'm based in Portland, Oregon. </p>
