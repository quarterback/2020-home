		<h1>Post-Service Design. Skeeball Pro.</h1>
		<p>I speak globally on iterative design, information architecture, product design, and a diverse array of UX-related topics. My day job is leading the product design at <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov">18F</a>. Previously, I've worked in a diverse array of roles across other slow-moving entities. </p>

	 <p>My talks around focused around reducing hostility, quantifying the cost of friction in design, and interrogating how designers have abdicated our responsibility for destructive patterns across digital products. I've been calling it <em> Consequence Design</em>. Before moving to the west coast, I started Indianapolis Design Week and Aggregate Conference.</p>

		<p>I'm happy to offer <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/omnivoreron">music recs</a>, loose-leaf tea tips, or talk about unwittingly becoming an American emissary for the Finnish version of baseball, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_navSFGj0I">Pes√§pallo.</a> 
		Sometimes, I coach high school tennis and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_polo">invented a sport</a>, once. Right now, I'm based in Portland, Oregon. </p>
