		<h1>Digital transformation expert. Information architect.</h1>
		<p>I work at the intersection of user experience (UX) and service design to help slow-moving entities modernize to better serve customers. The core of my practice is focused around reducing hostility, quantifying the cost of friction in design, and interrogating how designers have abdicated our responsibility for destructive patterns across digital products. I've been calling this emergent focus <em>Consequence Design</em>. </p>

		<p>Despite all of that, I'm pretty fun at parties. I'm happy to offer loose-leaf tea recommendations, or talk to you about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_navSFGj0I">Pes√§pallo.</a> 
		Sometimes, I coach high school tennis. I'm a game designer in the sense that I <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_polo">invented a sport once, too. </a>

		<p>I'm still working on this latest version of the site, but ideally, it'll feature a broader assortment of adventures rather than <em>only</em> focused on my work.</p>
