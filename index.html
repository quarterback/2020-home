		<p>I work at the intersection of user experience and (digital) product design to help slow-moving entities modernize to better serve <s>customers</s> the public. I speak globally on iterative design, information architecture, product design, and a diverse array of UX-related topics. My day job is leading the product design at <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov">18F</a>, a digital services agency inside the U.S. federal government. </p>

		<p>In the past, I managed several dozen large-scale CMS migrations for large (often-slow moving) entities around the country. <em>(Here's a talk about the time we <a href="https://now.ronbronson.com/project/2018-04-drupal">migrated a municipal website to Drupal 8</a>, while culling content to just (around) 500 pages</p>) </em>

	 <p>These days, my talks around focused around reducing hostility, quantifying the cost of friction in design, and interrogating how designers have abdicated our responsibility for destructive patterns across digital products. I've been calling it<em>Consequence Design</em>. </p>

		<p>Despite all of that, I'm pretty fun at parties.  I'm happy to offer <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/omnivoreron">music recs</a>, loose-leaf tea tips, or talk to you about how much I enjoy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_navSFGj0I">Pes√§pallo.</a>  I've been a lifelong fan of the New Jersey Devils, and (inexplicably) Toronto Blue Jays.
		Sometimes, I coach high school tennis and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_polo">invented a sport</a>, once.

		<p>I'm still working on this latest version of the site, but ideally, it'll feature a broader assortment of adventures rather than <em>only</em> focused on my work. </p>
		
		<p>Right now, I'm based in Portland, Oregon.</p>
