		<h1>Digital transformation. Information architect. Service designer.</h1>
		<p>I work at the intersection of user experience and (digital) product design to help slow-moving entities modernize to better serve <s>customers</s> the public. I speak globally on iterative design, content strategy, and a diverse array of UX-related topics. </p>

	 <p>My practice is focused around reducing hostility, quantifying the cost of friction in design, and interrogating how designers have abdicated our responsibility for destructive patterns across digital products. I've been calling this emergent focus <em>Consequence Design</em>. </p>

		<p>Despite all of that, I'm pretty fun at parties.  I'm happy to offer <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/omnivoreron">music recs</a>, loose-leaf tea tips, or talk to you about how much I enjoy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_navSFGj0I">Pesäpallo.</a>  I've been a lifelong fan of the New Jersey Devils, and (inexplicably) Toronto Blue Jays.
		Sometimes, I coach high school tennis. I'm a game designer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_polo">(invented a sport, once.)</a>

		<p>I'm still working on this latest version of the site, but ideally, it'll feature a broader assortment of adventures rather than <em>only</em> focused on my work. </p>
		
		<p>Right now, I'm based in Portland, Oregon.</p>
