<p>
	I lead cross-functional teams and work on impactful, people-focused design products and initiatives. 

	My practice is rooted in content strategy & information architecture, but I'm passionate about the work at the intersection of product & service design. These days, my research & work are focused on interrogating the ways harm is crafted into everyday experiences, and examining new ways for building teams, frameworks, and mental models for reducing friction that ruins experience. I've been calling this emergent practice, <em><a href="https://consequence.design/post/616408785711431680/on-consequence-design">Consequence Design</a></em>.</p>
	
	<p>For the past three years, I've worked on some of the world's biggest problems as part of <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov">18F</a>, an innovation product office within the federal government. 
	
	Prior to 18F, I was a service designer & front-end designer for a municipal government, led digital transformation for a state college system, and spent a decade managing web content and redesigns for public & private-sector entities. Before graduating college, I served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force.</p>

	<p>I've been fortunate to share what I've learned at design events around the world such as An Event Apart, Confab, et. al. In 2016, I started Indianapolis Design Week, and previously served on the boards of several non-profits like AIGA Indy & <a href="http://wfhb.org">WFHB-FM</a>, a community radio station.

	<p>I'm happy to offer <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/omnivoreron">music recs</a>, loose-leaf tea tips, or talk about unwittingly becoming an American emissary for the Finnish version of baseball, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_navSFGj0I">Pes√§pallo.</a> These days, I'm based in Portland, Oregon, where I coach high school tennis, and run a skeeball league.

	<p>Occasionally, I <a href="http://work.ronbronson.com/">blog</a> or write in a <a href="https://ronbronson.substack.com/">newsletter</a>. </p>
