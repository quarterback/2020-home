<p>
	I lead cross-functional teams, and work on impactful, people-focused design products and initiatives for close to two decades. 

	My practice is rooted in content strategy & information architecture, but I'm passionate about the work at the intersection of product & service design. These days, my practice is focused around the ways that harm is crafted into everyday experiences, and examining new ways for building teams, frameworks, and mental models for reducing friction that ruins experience.</p>
	
	<p>For the past three years, I've worked on some of the world's biggest problems as part of 18F, an innovation product office within the federal government. 
	
	Prior to 18F, I was a service designer & front-end designer for a municipal government, led digital transformation for a state college system, and spent a decade managing web content and redesigns for public & private-sector entities. Prior to graduating college, I spent four years on active duty in the U.S. Air Force.
	
	I've been fortunate to share what I've learned at design events around the world such as An Event Apart, Confab, et. al. In 2016, I also started Indianapolis Design Week, and have also served on the boards of several non-profits.

	<p>I'm happy to offer <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/omnivoreron">music recs</a>, loose-leaf tea tips, or talk about unwittingly becoming an American emissary for the Finnish version of baseball, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_navSFGj0I">Pes√§pallo.</a> In my spare time (ha), I coach high school tennis and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_polo">accidentally invented a sport</a>, once. </p>
