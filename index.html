		<h1>Designing resilence into a post-service world.</h1>


<h4>Work</h4>
<p>
	I lead cross-functional teams and work on impactful, people-focused design products and initiatives. Since 2006, I've been helping institutions, agencies, and large-scale entities scale digital transformation to improve the lives of everyday people. For nearly three years, I've worked on some of the world's biggest problems as part of <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov">18F</a>, an innovation product office within the federal government.</p>
	
	<p>Over the years, my work includes product strategy & digital transformation for complex institutions,  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REUJCWpFOcI">CMS migrations</a>, information architecture, user research & service design. I've led teams, and directed digital strategy in the private sector, as well as government. </p>

	<p>These days, my practice is focused on interrogating the ways harm is crafted into everyday experiences, and examining new ways for building teams, frameworks, and mental models for reducing friction that ruins experience, centered around a set of principles called <em><a href="https://consequence.design/post/616408785711431680/on-consequence-design">Consequence Design</a></em>.</p>

	<h4>Coaching & Community building</h4>
	I've also speak globally at world-class design, UX & tech events like An Event Apart, Confab, and many others. I also launched two successful conferences (including Indianapolis Design Week).

	When I don't have a mic in my hand, I'm holding a tennis racquet. I've been a coach for collegiate, high school, and private camps around the country.

	Right now, I'm the girls varsity head coach for a private high school in Portland.  

	<h4>Miscellanea</h4>
	<p>I'm happy to offer <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/omnivoreron">music recs</a>, loose-leaf tea tips, or talk about unwittingly becoming an American emissary for the Finnish version of baseball, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_navSFGj0I">Pes√§pallo.</a> 

	<p>Occasionally, I <a href="http://work.ronbronson.com/">blog</a> or write in a <a href="https://ronbronson.substack.com/">newsletter</a>. </p>
